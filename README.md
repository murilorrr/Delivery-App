## üòä **Why?**

<h4>The context:</h4>
Tereza's beer distributor is getting computerized! rocket Your business, previously focused on a specific location in the city, started to receive a massive amount of orders from other points, expanding its operations, especially via delivery. This is all thanks to the excellent price of drinks and service from the sales team.

Now the distributor has some points of sale in the city to speed up service in these areas. Each point of sale, in turn, has a responsible salesperson.

As her old system, which was a set of spreadsheets, no longer meets the business needs, as it generates a lot of maintenance, Dona Tereza turned to her team of developers with an idea for an application that could speed up the lives of her team and people. who buy your products. The app needs:

* Access via login: both customers and salespeople, as well as Tereza herself, who manages the system, must have access to the application via login, but for different functions:(1) The customer, who buys from the list of products; (2) The selling person, who approves, prepares and delivers; (3) The admin person, who manages who uses the application;

* Make communication between customers and salespeople: the customer person places the order via "shopping cart" and the salesperson approves, prepares and sends this order. When the product is received by the purchaser, that person marks the order as "received". Both must have details about their orders;

* Work in real-time: Orders/order details screens should be updated in real-time as these interactions take place. If the customer person places the order, it should appear to the sales person in their order dash without them needing to refresh the page. The customer, in turn, must have the information about their order also updated in real time, that is, have information if the order is being prepared or if it has already left for delivery;

The proposal enchanted, but Dona Tereza wants to see the business in action! She's willing to pay for a project MVP, and you've closed the deal with a 10-day turnaround time.

Now it's hands to work! Let's start?
